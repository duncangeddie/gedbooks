For all the accounts below in the list I want the status set to 2 which means mandatory

accounts list:



I also want the user to select from the following dropdown options to input a type when adding chart of accounts:

- asset
- liabilities
- equity
- income
- expenses

When a user selects a status it will reflect as the following values:

2 = Mandatory (To mark as a required account)
1 = Active (same as customers and suppliers)
0 = Inactive (same as customers and suppliers)
