REQUEST

Before I register a user and test I want another feature added.

When a user first registers an account I want the following databases created for that specific users data that only they access.

I want the database to be named user_[user id] (Use user id from users database for name)

In user_[user id] datbase I want the following tables to be created:

table named customers with the columns being:
- customer_name (single line text)
- email_address (single line text)
- tax_number (number)
- phone_number (number)
- address (multi line text)

table named suppliers with the columns being:
- supplier name (single line text)
- customer_name (single line text)
- email_address (single line text)
- tax_number (number)

table named chart_of_accounts with the columns being:
- account_number (automatic number like id)
- account_name (single line text)
